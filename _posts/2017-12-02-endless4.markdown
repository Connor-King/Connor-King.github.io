<b>Day 4</b>Added menu, game over screens and Kill Zone.<!--more-->

I basically re-used the code I had in my previous snake game to create a simple menu and end screen, these would simply have an image and you could press space to start or start again. The kill zone is basically checking if the players y co-ordinate is greater the games height and if so, kill the player.

#### Kill Zone
```C++
void EndlessGame::playerKillZone()
{
	if (player->returnYPos() > 720)
	{
		end();
	}
}
```
