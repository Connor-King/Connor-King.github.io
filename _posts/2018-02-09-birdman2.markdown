<b>Day 2 </b>Added interactable class, buttons and created the first level.<!--more-->

The interactable class has a value “interactable_player” so that different players can interact with different objects. The buttons on the first level are linked to other buttons, switching them on/off at the same time as the pressed button. The first puzzle is to figure out how to press all the buttons so that they are all on at the same time, once completed the door will open. The interactable class has 3 functions, check player collision to check if the player is colliding with the interactable, load avatar and render avatar.

#### Interactable Class
```C++
class Interactable  {
public:
	int interactable_player;
	virtual bool checkPlayerCollision	(float x, float y, float w, float h);
	virtual bool loadAvatar				(ASGE::Renderer* renderer);
	virtual bool render					(ASGE::Renderer* renderer);
private:
	float pos_x;
	float pos_y;
	float height;
	float width;
	ASGE::Sprite* avatar = nullptr;
};
```
