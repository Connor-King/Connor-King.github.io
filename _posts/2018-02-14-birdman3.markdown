<b>Day 3</b>Added door functionality and a second room layout.<!--more-->

I added a simple function that if the door is open, check whether player 1 is colliding with it and if so, loads the level 2 scene (code below). I also created a backdrop for the second level which will be a sliding blocks puzzle.

#### Level 2 Transition
```C++
if (door->open)
{
	float x = player_1->getX();
	float y = player_1->getY();
	float w = player_1->getWidth();
	float h = player_1->getHeight();
	
	if (door->checkPlayerCollision(x, y, w, h))
	{
		return GameSceneEnums::LEVEL_2;
	}
}
```
