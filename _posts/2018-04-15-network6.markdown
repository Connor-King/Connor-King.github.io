<b>Day 6 </b>Adding unit selection and player tags.<!--more-->

Here, I added a bit more code to the server when it sends over the map seed. Now, it also sends over a player number, depending on who connected to the server first, the first player becomes player 1 and the second becomes player 2. 

I also changed the main game code so that when the map is generated, both players send over a packet containing their selection of characters which will update each clientâ€™s opposing team.

#### Sending Player Unit Choice
```C++
void Level1::startUnits()
{
	MyPacket unit_stats(20);
	unit_stats << 10000;
	unit_stats << c1;
	unit_stats << c2;
	unit_stats << c3;
	unit_stats << c4;
	unit_queue.push(unit_stats);
	std::cout << "sent start units";
```
