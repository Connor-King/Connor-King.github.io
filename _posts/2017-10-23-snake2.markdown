<b>Day 2</b>Added collisions to the game borders.<!--more-->

Added a simple script that checks whether the sprite is below 0 on x axis or y axis or is above the window height on y axis or above window width on x axis. If the sprite goes past these points, the game restarts, for now.

#### How does it work?
```C++
if (body.posX <= 0 || BodyVector[0].posX >= WINDOW_WIDTH - 25)
	{
		game_action = GameAction::RESTART;
	}
if (body.posY <= 71 || BodyVector[0].posY >= WINDOW_HEIGHT - 25)
	{
		game_action = GameAction::RESTART;
	}
```

This is the first iteration of this system and will change in the future.
