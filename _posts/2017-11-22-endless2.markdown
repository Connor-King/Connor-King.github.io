<b>Day 2</b>Adding the jump.<!--more-->

The jump took longer than expected, I first started with simply changing the Y     co-ordinate when space is pressed but this just teleports the player up. This looked bad so instead I wrote a function that moves the player up and then stops when it reaches a certain height. I also had to change the gravity function that made the player fall so that when the player was jumping, gravity would not be enabled.

#### Jumping
```C++
void EndlessGame::playerJump(double time)
{
	if (player_jump == true)
	{
		player->jumping = true;
		player->grounded = false;
		player->pos_y -= time * 100;
		
		if (player->pos_y <= player->jump_limit)
		{
			player->jumping = false;
			player_jump = false;
		}
	}
}
```
