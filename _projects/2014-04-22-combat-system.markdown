#### Unity Combat System
This is a combat system and boss which I created within Unity for a university assignment. I added different movement styles, easily changeable stats and an area which it patrolls to the boss. I also added a lot of user feedback for the combat system including, screen flash, screen shake, controller rumble, knockback, material flash and more.
