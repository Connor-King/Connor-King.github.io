#### Unreal Engine Conversation Tree
This is my version of a conversation tree within Unreal Engine 4. I created this for a University assignment. It is easily expandable and easily added to other NPCs. It is also really easy to add conversation outomcomes/effects.

#### Features
1. Easily Implemented
2. Easy to Expand
3. Easy to Implement Effects/Conversation Outcomes
4. Change the Conversation From Within the Editor
