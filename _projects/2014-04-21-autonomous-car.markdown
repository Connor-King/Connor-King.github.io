#### Autonomous Car with Python and TensorFlow
The aim of this project is to create a virtual autonomous car within Unity using TensorFlow and Python. The network takes in an image from the front of the car and produces a keypress to control the car, being either W to go forward, A to turn left and D to turn right. The current example has only been trained on a very small set of training data but still works.
